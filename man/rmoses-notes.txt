                                        corresponds to the arity. Note that for
                                        multiplex (mux) the problem size must
                                        be equal to n+2^n. For regression of

                                        value provided with that option then
                                        the dataset is subsampled randomly to
                                        reach the target size.

  -q [ --min-rand-input ] arg (=0)      Min of an input value chosen randomly,
                                        only used when the problem takes
                                        continuous inputs.

  -w [ --max-rand-input ] arg (=1)      Max of an input value chosen randomly,
                                        only used when the problem takes

                                        does not matter.

  -L [ --log-file-dep-opt ]             The name of the log is determined by
                                        the options, for instance if moses-exec
                                        is called with -r 123 -H pa the log
                                        name is moses_random-seed_123_problem_p
                                        a.log. Note that the name will be
                                        truncated in order not to be longer
                                        than 255 characters.

                                        each candidate's output, useful if the
                                        data are noisy or to control an Occam's
                                        razor bias, 0 or negative means no
                                        Occam's razor, otherwise the higher v
                                        the stronger the Occam's razor.

                                        probability that an output datum is
                                        wrong (returns false while it should
                                        return true or the other way around),
                                        useful if the data are noisy or to
                                        control an Occam's razor bias, only
                                        values 0 < p < 0.5 are meaningful, out
                                        of this range it means no Occam's
                                        razor, otherwise the greater p the
                                        greater the Occam's razor.

  -N [ --include-only-operator ] arg    Include only the operator in the
                                        solution, can be used several times,
                                        for the moment only plus, times, div,
                                        sin, exp, log and variables (#n) are
                                        supported. Note that variables and
                                        operators are decoralated (including
                                        only some operators still include all
                                        variables and including only some
                                        variables still include all operators).
                                        You may need to put variables under
                                        double quotes. This option does not
                                        work with ANN.

  -n [ --ignore-operator ] arg          Ignore the following operator in the
                                        program solution, can be used several
                                        times, for the moment only div, sin,
                                        exp, log and variables (#n) can be
                                        ignored. You may need to put variables
                                        under double quotes. This option has
                                        the priority over include-only-operator
                                        . That is if an operator is both be
                                        included and ignored, it is ignored.
                                        This option does not work with ANN.

  -a [ --opt-algo ] arg (=hc)           Optimization algorithm, supported

  -d [ --reduce-all ] arg (=1)          Reduce all candidates before being
                                        evaluated, otherwise there are only
                                        reduced before being added to the
                                        metapopulation. This option can be
                                        valuable if the cache is enabled to not
                                        re-evaluate duplicates.

                                        effort, 3 means maximum effort. The
                                        bigger the effort the lower the
                                        dimension of the deme.

  -s [ --enable-cache ] arg (=1)        Cache, so that identical candidates are
                                        not re-evaluated, the cache siz is
                                        dynamically adjusted to fit in the RAM.

  -R [ --revisit ]                      Revisit visited examplars when all have

  -j [ --jobs ] arg                     Number of jobs allocated for deme
                                        optimization. Jobs can be executed on a
                                        remote machine as well, in such case
                                        the notation -j N:REMOTE_HOST is used.
                                        For instance one can enter the options
                                        -j 4 -j 16:my_server.org (or -j
                                        16:user@my_server.org if wishes to run
                                        the remote jobs under a different user
                                        name), meaning that 4 jobs are
                                        allocated on the local machine and 16
                                        jobs are allocated on my_server.org.
                                        The assumption is that moses-exec must
                                        be on the remote machine and is located
                                        in a directory included in the PATH
                                        environment variable. Beware that a lot
                                        of log files are gonna be generated
                                        when using this option.

  -P [ --pop-size-ratio ] arg (=20)     The higher the more effort is spent on

                                        explore a deme is determined by that
                                        value * log2(information_theoretic_bits
                                        (deme)).

  -I [ --ignore-bscore ] arg (=0)       Ignore the behavioral score when
                                        merging candidates in the population.
                                        This option is useful either when the
                                        problem has no obvious behavioral
                                        score, or it happens that dominated
                                        candidates worth keeping.

  -T [ --hc-terminate-if-improvement ] arg (=1)
                                        Hillclimbing parameter. If 1 then deme
                                        search terminates when an improvement
                                        is found, if 0 it keeps searching until
                                        another termination condition is
                                        reached.
